This will act as a repository for all mod files for the game Stellaris 
Anyone is free to contribute to this, either to offer bug fixes or else to 
make suggestions for modifying gameplay functionality. In general I will 
focus on the following three things: 

1) Adding new galaxy maps (i.e. larger galaxies, different types such as quasars, etc.) 
2) Adding new technologies 
3) Adding new planetary combat units (i.e. armored divisions, etc.) 

Below is a log of all mod files added or debugged to date:
